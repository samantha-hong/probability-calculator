# Probability Calculator

I created this Probability Calculator because the next chapter that I am teaching requires students to use factorials, permutations, and combinations. Not all students have access to calculators that can perform these functions, and typing in all the numbers can be tedious The calculator will only accept whole numbers (and error will be shown if a number is negative or a decimal).

This project was great practice using event listeners and functions with conditionals and loops. The inputs are first checked to ensure that they are positive whole numbers; if they are not, an error message appears. For permutations and combinations, the "n" value (left value) must be greater than the "r" value (right value). For factorials, the input of "0" will have an output of "1" because it is a special case of factorial.
