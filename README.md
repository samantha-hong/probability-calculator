# Probability Calculator

I created this Probability Calculator because the next chapter that I am teaching requires students to use factorials, permutations, and combinations. Not all students have access to calculators that can perform these functions, and typing in all the numbers can be tedious The calculator will only accept whole numbers (and error will be shown if a number is negative or a decimal).

This project was great practice using event listeners and functions with conditionals and loops.
